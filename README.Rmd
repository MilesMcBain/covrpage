# remedy

`{remedy}` provides addins to facilitate writing in markdown with RStudio.

![](remedy_example.gif)

All the functions are meant to be mapped to keyboard shortcuts. A list of suggested shortcuts is provided towards the end of this README. 

> Note that most of the addins/shortcuts below will also work without selecting any text.

## Install

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ThinkR-open/remedy")
```

Once you've installed the package, you don't need to load it with `library()`, the addins are installed on your machine as part of the package install process. 

## Using `{remedy}`

Write quicker in markdown with `{remedy}`!

Here's a list of all available helpers:

![](readme_gif/remedy_example.gif)

### Align

Align selected blocks to their assignment operator, either `<-`

![](readme_gif/align.gif)

or `=`

![](readme_gif/alignequal.gif)

### Backtick

Enclose the selected word(s) in backticks. 

![](readme_gif/backtick.gif)

### Chunk

Turn the selected text into a chunk.

### Emphasise

Embolden, italicize or strikethrough the selected text.

![](readme_gif/emphasise.gif)

### Headers

Turn the selected text into a header.

![](readme_gif/header.gif)

### Image

Turn the selected path into an image. 

This element is context aware: if you select a text and a link, it turns the text into title between `![]`, and puts the link between `()`. 

If the last element of the selection is not a link, you get an error message straight into you markdown document.

### LaTeX

LaTeX syntax :

### List

Turn the selected text into an unordered list. 

![](readme_gif/list.gif)

### Moving 

#### On the right 

Copy the selected text or the current line to the right.

### Table

Insert a table inside your doc.

There are basically two way to do that with remedy : 

#### Empty table

![](readme_gif/table.gif)

#### Parse your data 

Turn your dataframe into a markdown table :

![](readme_gif/table_remedy.gif)


### URL

Turn the selected text into an url. 

This element is context aware: if you select a text and a link, it turns the text into title between `[]`, and puts the link between `()`. 

If the last element of the selection is not a link, you get an error message straight into you markdown document.

### xaringan 

Insert a xaringan pull-left and pull-right template.

## Recommended shortcuts

Here's a list of recommended shortcuts: 

### On mac 

You can run `remedy::set_hotkeys` to have the package update for you the hotkey settings for your RStudio IDE. If you want to edit the default settings you can view the defaults `remedy_opts$get('hotkeys')` and change them through `remedy_opts$set(hotkeys=<NEW_SETTINGS>)`.

```{r}
remedy::remedy_opts$get('hotkeys')
```

<!-- 
Due to a [limitation](https://community.rstudio.com/t/keyboard-shortcut-for-addin-in-dcf-file/2753) currently of the IDE you will need to restart the IDE once for the hotkeys to be initialized. 
-->
